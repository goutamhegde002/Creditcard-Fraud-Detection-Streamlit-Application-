# Credit Card Fraud Detection App

This project is a Streamlit web application for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The app allows users to upload credit card transaction data, preprocess it, and detect anomalies that indicate potential fraud.

## Features

- **Data Upload:** Users can upload their own credit card transaction datasets in CSV format.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The app standardizes the transaction amounts and time features, and applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Uses machine learning models like Isolation Forest to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Visualization:** Provides scatter plots to visualize anomalies within PCA-transformed components.
- **Interactive Interface:** Built with Streamlit, allowing easy interaction and visualization of results.
